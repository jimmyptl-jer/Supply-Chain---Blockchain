For example, there can be separate smart contracts for product creation, transportation, quality inspection, and transaction finalization.

Step 2: Develop Smart Contract Functions: Within each smart contract, various functions will be developed to implement the business logic and rules for that specific stage. Here are some essential functions that can be included in the smart contracts:
1. addProduct: This function will be called by the dairy product producer to add a new batch of dairy products to the supply chain. It will capture information such as batch ID, product type, quantity, and production date.
2. updateTemperature: This function will be called by the transportation provider or IoT sensors to update the temperature readings of the dairy products during transportation. It will record the temperature readings along with the timestamp.
3. updateQualityMetrics: This function will allow authorized participants, such as quality inspectors, to update quality metrics of the dairy products. It may include parameters like freshness, taste, and overall quality.
4. verifyTemperatureCompliance: This function will be used to verify if the recorded temperature readings during transportation are within the acceptable range. If the temperature is outside the bounds, a penalty may be applied.
5. verifyQualityCompliance: This function will check the quality metrics provided by inspectors and determine if the dairy products meet the required quality standards. Penalties may apply for subpar quality.
6. completeTransaction: This function will finalize the transaction, calculate the price based on temperature and quality compliance, and transfer the payment to the respective parties.
7. getTemperatureHistory: This function will allow authorized participants to access the temperature history of the dairy products, ensuring transparency and traceability.
8. getQualityMetrics: This function will provide access to the quality metrics of the dairy products, allowing stakeholders to assess the product's overall quality.

Step 3: Implementing Data Privacy and Access Control:
Data privacy is critical in supply chain management, especially when dealing with sensitive information like temperature readings and quality metrics. The smart contracts will implement access controls to ensure that only authorized participants can access specific data elements. Encryption techniques may also be applied to protect sensitive information.

Step 4: Regulatory Compliance:
Smart contracts will be designed to comply with relevant regulatory requirements for supply chain management, such as food safety standards and quality control regulations. The functions within the smart contracts will enforce these compliance rules during the execution of transactions.

Step 5: Testing and Deployment:
Before deploying the smart contracts to the blockchain network, thorough testing will be conducted to ensure their correctness and effectiveness. Once tested and verified, the smart contracts will be deployed to the blockchain network to become active and enforce the rules of the supply chain.

3. Data Encryption: Before pushing the data to the blockchain, it is essential to ensure the data's security and privacy. The data will be encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access and maintain its confidentiality.

4. Smart Contract Interaction: Smart contracts deployed on the blockchain will include functions to handle data updates. For example, the "updateTemperature" function in the smart contract provided earlier can be called by authorized parties (e.g., transporters or IoT devices) to update the temperature readings for a specific batch of dairy products.

5. Transaction Creation: When an authorized party calls the relevant smart contract function to update data, a transaction is created and signed with the party's private key. This transaction contains the updated data (e.g., temperature readings) as part of its payload.

6. Transaction Submission: The signed transaction is then submitted to the blockchain network for processing. The ordering service (mentioned in the infrastructure setup) ensures that the transactions are ordered in a consistent manner.

7. Consensus and Confirmation: The transaction is then processed by the peer nodes in the network using the consensus mechanism of the blockchain (e.g., PoW or PBFT). Once consensus is reached, the transaction is confirmed and added to a new block in the blockchain.

Retrieving Data from the Blockchain for Analysis:

1. Querying Smart Contracts: To retrieve data from the blockchain for analysis, authorized parties can call specific functions within the smart contract. For example, the "getTemperatureHistory" function in the smart contract allows authorized participants to access the temperature readings history for a particular batch of dairy products.

2. Data Privacy and Access Control: The smart contracts are designed with access controls, ensuring that only authorized parties can query specific data elements. The identity of the party making the query is verified using their unique digital certificate issued by the Certificate Authority (CA).

3. Data Analysis Tools Integration: Data analysis tools, such as IBM Watson Studio and IBM Cloud Pak for Data, can be integrated with the blockchain network. These tools have APIs and connectors that allow them to query data from the blockchain for analysis.

4. Real-time Analytics: Since the blockchain contains an immutable record of all transactions and data updates, real-time analytics can be performed on the blockchain data. This allows stakeholders to monitor the supply chain's health, identify trends, and respond to issues promptly.

5. Data Visualization: Analysis results can be presented in the form of interactive dashboards and reports using data visualization tools. Stakeholders can view key performance indicators, trends, and insights in a user-friendly and actionable format.

6. Data Export: If needed, data can be exported from the blockchain network and integrated with external analytics platforms for more advanced data processing and machine learning.
